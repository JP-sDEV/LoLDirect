### `Why Make This?`

I am a League of Legends player and fan of [Esports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports) and wanted to create something that I am passionate about.

I enjoyed designing and making this application. I was able to practice improve my HTML / CSS by making this responsive to mobile and desktop screens.
